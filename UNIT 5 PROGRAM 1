Pseudocode for BFS:
// Here, Graph is the graph that we already have and X is the source node
Breadth_First_Search( Graph, X ):
    Let Q be the queue
    Q.enqueue( X )     // Inserting source node X into the queue
    Mark X node as visited.
    While ( Q is not empty )
        Y = Q.dequeue( )     // Removing the front node from the queue
    Process all the neighbors of Y, For all the neighbors Z of Y
    If Z is not visited:
        Q. enqueue( Z )     // Stores Z in Q
        Mark Z as visited
