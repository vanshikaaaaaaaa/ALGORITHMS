let dist be V × V matrix of minimum distances initialized to INFINITY
for each vertex v
  dist[v][v] = 0
for each edge (u, v)
  dist[u][v] = weight(u, v)
 
for k from 0 to |V| – 1
  for i from 0 to |V| – 1
    for j from 0 to |V| – 1
      if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]) is less than dist[i][j] then
        dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
