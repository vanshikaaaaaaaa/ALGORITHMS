Pseudocode
Algorithm: Max-Clique (G, n, k)
S := ф
for i = 1 to k do
   t := choice (1…n) 
   if t є S then
      return failure
   S := S U t 
for all pairs (i, j) such that i є S and j є S and i ≠ j do
   if (i, j) is not a edge of the graph then 
      return failure
return success

Analysis
Max-Clique problem is a non-deterministic algorithm. In this algorithm, first we try to determine a set of k distinct vertices and then we try to test whether these vertices form a complete graph.
There is no polynomial time deterministic algorithm to solve this problem. This problem is NP-Complete.
