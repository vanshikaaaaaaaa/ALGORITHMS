 In recent years, large-scale parallel computing based on graphics processor unit (GPU) has greatly improved the computing efficiency of computer graphics processing. GPU also provides a good parallel computing platform for general-purpose computing [4, 5]. NVIDIA's compute unified device architecture (CUDA) [6] provides a convenient means for researchers to use the GPU for data parallel processing. The use of GPU architecture combines low cost and high performance, which has broad application prospects.
 It has been widely used in fields such as medical imaging, molecular dynamics, gene comparison, and financial simulation [7-9].
